# This Python script is used within the OS X release process, to ensure
# that the standalone OS X ZIP files which we make are actually
# standalone, and not implicitly dependent on Homebrew installs for
# external libraries which we use.
#
# This implicit dependencies seem to show up only where we have
# external dependencies which are dependent on each other, and the
# path from one to another is an absolute path to "/usr/local/opt",
# the Homebrew install location.   External dependencies which only
# depend on system libraries are fine.   Our main applications seem
# to be fine.
#
# An example of a dependency which requires this fix-up at the time
# of writing is the following dependency edge:
#
# libjsonrpccpp-client.0.dylib
#     -> /usr/local/opt/jsoncpp/lib/libjsoncpp.0.dylib
#
# See https://blogs.oracle.com/dipol/entry/dynamic_libraries_rpath_and_mac
# for a little overview of "install_name_tool" and "otool".
