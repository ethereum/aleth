/**
 * @brief Representation of connectivity state and all other pertinent Peer metadata.
 * A Peer represents connectivity between two nodes, which in this case, are the host
 * and remote nodes.
 *
 * State information necessary for loading network topology is maintained by NodeTable.
 *
 * @todo Implement 'bool required'
 * @todo reputation: Move score, rating to capability-specific map (&& remove friend class)
 * @todo reputation: implement via origin-tagged events
 * @todo Populate metadata upon construction; save when destroyed.
 * @todo Metadata for peers needs to be handled via a storage backend. 
 * Specifically, peers can be utilized in a variety of
 * many-to-many relationships while also needing to modify shared instances of
 * those peers. Modifying these properties via a storage backend alleviates
 * Host of the responsibility. (&& remove save/restoreNetwork)
 * @todo reimplement recording of historical session information on per-transport basis
 * @todo move attributes into protected
