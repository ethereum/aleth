# Installation

Installation is a different process dependent on which platform you run. At present, aleth supports three platforms: Ubuntu, Mac OS X and Windows.

For installing the desktop tools on Windows and Mac, just grab the latest release. (For Windows you might also need [this](http://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=40784).)

For installing on Ubuntu or Homebrew, instructions follow.

# Installing on Ubuntu 14.04 and later (64-bit)

**Warning: The `ethereum-qt` PPA will upgrade your system-wide Qt5 installation, from 5.2 on Trusty and 5.3 on Utopic, to 5.5.**

For the latest stable version:
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ethereum/ethereum-qt
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ethereum/ethereum
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install aleth
```

If you want to use the cutting edge developer version:
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ethereum/ethereum-qt
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ethereum/ethereum
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ethereum/ethereum-dev
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install aleth
```

# Installing on OS X and Homebrew

If you want the full suite of CLI tools, include `eth` and `ethminer`, you'll need [Homebrew](brew.sh).

Once you've got Homebrew installed, tap the ethereum brew:
```
brew tap ethereum/ethereum
```

Then, for the stable version:
```
brew install aleth
brew linkapps aleth
```

or, for the latest cutting edge developer version:
```
brew reinstall aleth --devel
brew linkapps aleth
```
