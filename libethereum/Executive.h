 * @brief Message-call/contract-creation executor; useful for executing transactions.

 * Two ways of using this class - either as a transaction executive or a CALL/CREATE executive.
 * In the first use, after construction, begin with setup() and end with finalize(). Call go()
 * after setup() only if it returns false.
 * In the second use, after construction, begin with call() or create() and end with
 * accrueSubState(). Call go() after call()/create() only if it returns false.
