/**
 * Optimizer step that performs common subexpression elimination and stack reorganisation,
 * i.e. it tries to infer equality among expressions and compute the values of two expressions
 * known to be equal only once.
 *
 * The general workings are that for each assembly item that is fed into the eliminator, an
 * equivalence class is derived from the operation and the equivalence class of its arguments.
 * DUPi, SWAPi and some arithmetic instructions are used to infer equivalences while these
 * classes are determined.
 *
 * When the list of optimized items is requested, they are generated in a bottom-up fashion,
 * adding code for equivalence classes that were not yet computed.
