# Bash script for installing pre-requisite packages for cpp-ethereum on a
# variety of Linux and other UNIX-derived platforms.
#
# This is an "infrastucture-as-code" alternative to the manual build
# instructions pages which we previously maintained, first as Wiki pages
# and later as readthedocs pages at http://ethdocs.org.
#
# The aim of this script is to simplify things down to the following basic
# flow for all supported operating systems:
#
# - git clone --recursive
# - ./install_deps.sh
# - cmake && make
#
# At the time of writing we are assuming that 'lsb_release' is present for all
# Linux distros, which is not a valid assumption.  We will need a variety of
# approaches to actually get this working across all the distros which people
# are using.
#
# See http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/92199/how-can-i-reliably-get-the-operating-systems-name
# for some more background on this common problem.
#
# TODO - There is no support here yet for cross-builds in any form, only
# native builds.  Expanding the functionality here to cover the mobile,
# wearable and SBC platforms covered by doublethink and EthEmbedded would
# also bring in support for Android, iOS, watchOS, tvOS, Tizen, Sailfish,
# Maemo, MeeGo and Yocto.
