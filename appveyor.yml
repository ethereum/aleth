# This is the deploy target for Windows which generates ZIPs per commit.
# We are in agreement that generating ZIPs per commit for the develop
# branch is probably just noise, so we only run this deployment target
# on 'release'.
#
# See https://www.appveyor.com/docs/deployment/github for information
# on GitHub Releases in Appveyor.
#
# You need to generate a GitHub personal access token for Appveyor
# See https://github.com/settings/tokens for more information on that.
# The token you generate there (in an encrypted form) is what is
# passed to this deployment target in the 'auth_token' parameter
# below.
