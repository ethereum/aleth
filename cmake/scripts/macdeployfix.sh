	# This is due to a known bug in QT5, and we have to fix up the linked libraries if we're going to have a distributable
	# result of building. When https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-50155 is fixed, this should be able

	#
	# Bob Summerwill added an extra hack into this loop on 2nd March specifically for
	# libdbus, which is used by the GUI apps from within Qt5.  The hacks-on-hacks which
	# we have make this code an absolute morass to understand.  Ideally we wouldn't
	# need this script at all, and maybe the need for it will disappear if we can
	# eliminate the need for "--with-d-bus" for our Qt5 usage, which then forces us
	# to build from source.
	#
	# We have had open tickets in the Qt project, in the Homebrew project itself,
	# in our brew formula and now here in this script.   It is a nightmare.  This
	# most recent hack seems to get us working, but it is by no means a good
	# solution.   Nothing in this whole chain-of-hacks is good.
	#
	# Yes - the dylib filename is specific to the D-Bus version.   We will never
	# reuse this script.  It needs to work, and not a lot more than that.
