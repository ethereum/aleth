# Module for locating the Crypto++ encryption library.
#
# Customizable variables:
#   CRYPTOPP_ROOT_DIR
#     This variable points to the CryptoPP root directory. On Windows the
#     library location typically will have to be provided explicitly using the
#     -D command-line option. The directory should include the include/cryptopp,
#     lib and/or bin sub-directories.
#
# Read-only variables:
#   CRYPTOPP_FOUND
#     Indicates whether the library has been found.
#
#   CRYPTOPP_INCLUDE_DIRS
#     Points to the CryptoPP include directory.
#
#   CRYPTOPP_LIBRARIES
#     Points to the CryptoPP libraries that should be passed to
#     target_link_libararies.
