# The Windows platform has not historically had any standard packaging system for delivering
# versioned releases of libraries.  Homebrew and PPA perform that function for macOS and Ubuntu
# respectively, and there are analogous standards for other Linux distros.  In the absense of
# such a standard, we have chosen to make a "fake packaging system" for cpp-ethereum, which is
# implemented in https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-dependencies.
#
# NOTE - In the last couple of years, the NuGet packaging system, first created for delivery
# of .NET packages, has added support for C++ packages, and it may be possible for us to migrate
# our "fake package server" to that real package server.   That would certainly be preferable
# to rolling our own, but it also puts us at the mercy of intermediate package maintainers who
# may be inactive.  There is not a fantastic range of packages available at the time of writing,
# so we might find that such a move turns us into becoming the package maintainer for our
# dependencies.   Not a net win :-)
#
# "Windows - Try to use NuGet C++ packages"
# https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/issues/509
#
# Perhaps a better alternative is to step away from dependencies onto binary releases entirely,
# and switching to build-from-source for some (or all) of our dependencies, especially if they
# are small.  That gives us total control, but at the cost of longer build times.  That is the
# approach which Pawel has taken for LLVM in https://github.com/ethereum/evmjit.

# We have work-in-progress here to support building cpp-ethereum with static-linkage, which

# which are entirely atomic and "just work".  They contain everything you need and talk directly
# to the operating system kernel.  Such linkage also allow best-possible dead-code removal and
# global optimizations.  That is the model which is used by default for all golang apps.
#
# "Enable static build of binaries"
# https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/issues/495
#
# So we just have `geth` and `geth.exe`.  This mode lets you have an `eth` which works just
# the same.  This approach is a particular benefit on Linux where there is huge fragmentation
# of packaging systems and .so versioning across distros.  Building a standalone executable
# for Linux which "just works" on all distros would be a huge win.  This mode allows just
# that to happen already on Alpine Linux using the musl standard library, and I hope we can
# extend that support to further distros in the near future.
