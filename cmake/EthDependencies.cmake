# The Windows platform has not historically had any standard packaging system for delivering
# versioned releases of libraries.  Homebrew and PPA perform that function for macOS and Ubuntu
# respectively, and there are analogous standards for other Linux distros.  In the absense of
# such a standard, we have chosen to make a "fake packaging system" for cpp-ethereum, which is
# implemented in https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-dependencies.
#
# NOTE - In the last couple of years, the NuGet packaging system, first created for delivery
# of .NET packages, has added support for C++ packages, and it may be possible for us to migrate
# our "fake package server" to that real package server.   That would certainly be preferable
# to rolling our own, but it also puts us at the mercy of intermediate package maintainers who
# may be inactive.  There is not a fantastic range of packages available at the time of writing,
# so we might find that such a move turns us into becoming the package maintainer for our
# dependencies.   Not a net win :-)

#
# Perhaps a better alternative is to step away from dependencies onto binary releases entirely,
# and switching to build-from-source for some (or all) of our dependencies, especially if they
# are small.  That gives us total control, but at the cost of longer build times.  That is the
# approach which Pawel has taken for LLVM in https://github.com/ethereum/evmjit.
