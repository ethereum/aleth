### UP FOR GRABS

Tests
- Use standard tests.

Crypto stuff:
- kFromMessage
- Check all the tweak instructions.

Better handling of corrupt blocks.

Network:
- Firewall-busting PeerConnections. UPnP?
- Crypto on network. TLS?
- Make work with IPv6
- Consider node addresses


### GAV

FOR ALPHA:

Network:
* Manage GetBlocks properly; should work for when > 256 blocks away.
  - configurable (lower) mine times, configurable (reduced) max blocks to be sent then check.
* Kill peers when too many
  - Respect idealPeerCount.
  - Peer network traversal for peer discovery. 
  - Check peer utility (useful transactions & blocks passed) for when dismissing.
  - Respect peer count & dismiss/collect/stop listening for peers as necessary.

UI:
* State panel shouldn't show pending (i.e. post-mined) transactions.

PoW:
* Minute mine times. DONE (ish)


### ERIC

Build:
* Windows build.


LATER:

Trie on DB.
- Move the restore point stuff into block restore points
  - i.e. keep all nodes from last 127 blocks with counter, at 128, kill but keep every (60*24*7)th or so i.e. one per week as a restore point.
  - maybe allow this to be configured.


### TIM

Stateful Miner class.

Better Mod-Exp.
