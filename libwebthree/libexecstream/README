Documentation:

Features:
    Works on Linux and Windows 
    Uses threads 
    Does not depend on any other non-standard library 
    Distributed as source code only, requires you to compile and link 
    one file into your program

Installaion:

Libexecstream is provided in source code form only. 
In order to use it, you need to compile and link one file, exec-stream.cpp, 
into your program. 

Header file exec-stream.h defines interface of the library and uses 
only standard C++. It does not include any platform-specific header files. 

On Linux, libexecstream was tested on Red Hat 9 with gcc compiler. 
Versions of gcc prior to 3.0 will not work. Make sure that exec-stream.h 
is found somewhere on the include path, compile exec-stream.cpp as usual, 
link your program with -lpthread. GCC must be configured with --enable-threads,
which is by default on most Linux distributions. 

On Windows, libexecstream was tested on XP and 95 flavors with VC++ 7 compiler.
VC++ 6 will not work. Make sure that exec-stream.h is found somewhere 
on the include path, compile exec-stream.cpp as usual, link you program 
with multi-threaded runtime. 

Example makefiles for Windows and Linux (used to build the testsute) 
are provided in the test subdirectory.
